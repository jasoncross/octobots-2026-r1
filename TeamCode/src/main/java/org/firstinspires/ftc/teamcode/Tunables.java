/**
 * Robot 1, version 1 (file 2 of 5): the NUMBERS, one section per part. A section's name is the part's
 * name in the robot configuration in CamelCase: "intake_deploy" reads IntakeDeploy.
 *
 * DEFAULT = "use the library's starting value" (the number in brackets in each comment). MEASURE =
 * "a number only our robot can give": INIT stops until we write it.
 * Change one only when you see the problem it fixes. Every setting, what it does and when to change it:
 * https://crossbotics.com/ftc-helper/docs/guides/tunables/ (start with "Find a setting by what you want").
 *
 * Tune on the robot with the tuning menu (PRACTICE profile: INIT, START, then hold GUIDE on gamepad 1
 * for 1 s): INIT lists every value that differs from this file, ready to copy back. This file stays the
 * record. The finders ("Tune and check", in the "Finders" group on the Driver Station) measure
 * the numbers and show the lines to copy here.
