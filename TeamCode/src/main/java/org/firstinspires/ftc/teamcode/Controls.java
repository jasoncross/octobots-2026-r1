/**
 * Robot 1, version 1 (file 3 of 5): the BUTTONS, and the TeleOp. Like goBILDA's code, one driver does
 * everything on gamepad 1 ({@code oneDriver = true}):
 * - left stick drives and strafes (sideways), right stick X turns. LT: slow while held (left stick
 *   click: slow on/off). Right stick click: field-centric on/off
 * - the intake runs once it is deployed (just after START). B: intake on / off. Double-tap B: push pieces out, until B is
 *   tapped again (then it runs in).
 * - the flywheel spins from START and stays at speed, ready. LB: coast it (when parked) / spin up again
 * - RB fires one POLLEN: the two feed arms pinch together behind it and push it into the wheel (it waits until the
 *   wheel is at speed; hold RB to keep firing until you let go)
 * - D-pad up/down: flywheel speed +/- 100 RPM
 * - X: push the intake over again (if it did not fall at START)
